                      Apache ServiceMix 7.0.0.M1
                  ================================
 Overview
 --------

  !! This is a technology preview release of Apache ServiceMix, and should NOT be considered production ready !!

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that unifies the features and functionality
of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF, and Karaf into a powerful runtime platform you can use to build your own 
integrations solutions.

Apache ServiceMix 7.0.0 will be the first release based on Karaf 4.0.x, which includes numerous new features. 
We ask that users provide the community with their feed back so that the full Apache ServiceMix 7.0.0 release 
can be as feature complete and stable as possible.

Apache ServiceMix 7.0.0.M1 is a new preview release of the project, which includes:

- Apache ActiveMQ 5.13.0 (http://activemq.apache.org)
- Apache Camel 2.16.2 (http://camel.apache.org)
- Apache CXF 3.1.4 (http://cxf.apache.org)
- Apache Karaf 4.0.4 (http://karaf.apache.org)
