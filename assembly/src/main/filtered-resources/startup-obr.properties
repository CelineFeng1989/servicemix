# workaround for SM-2469
#
# some standard features install the version 2.2 of joda-time bundle ans bundles which depend on joda-time
# wire to this bundle. Later installation of activiti fails, because it needs higher version of joda-time
# and activiti tries to resolve this bundle via multiple paths. Starting this bundle as soon as possible
# should force another bundles to wire this bundle (when compatible with the dependency requirements) instead
# of installing another versions
